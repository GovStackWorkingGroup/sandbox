# GovStack Sandbox

The GovStack Sandbox is a unified environment for all the GovStack and digital government
ecosystem actors to discover, understand, engage, experiment, innovate, and build digital
government solutions using the GovStack platform. The sandbox provides an API environment that public and private
agencies can use to mimic the characteristics exhibited by the GovStack platform and environment on a real-time basis to
help simulate responses from all the systems an application interfaces with. This especially enables government agencies
and digital government players to experiment with innovative GovTech products or services within a well-defined space
and duration. The design of the GovStack sandbox encapsulates the business logic and data necessary to represent multiple
GovStack capabilities such as APIs, building blocks, use cases and transaction flows. This helps developers and digital
government agencies to achieve a more holistic view of the GovStack. The GovStack is accessible through the virtual cloud
presence and the sandbox is in a separate deployment environment with virtual users and transactional capabilities that
are similar to a production system.

## Get started

The sandbox is reusable and replicable, which means you can set up your own GovStack sandbox within your own environment.

To get more details check out the [infrastructure documentation](https://github.com/GovStackWorkingGroup/sandbox-infra). 

## Candidates for building blocks
In the Sandbox, you have the freedom to configure your own setup and run any building blocks of your choice.
