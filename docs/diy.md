# Built your own Sandbox

The sandbox is reusable and replicable, which means you can set up your own GovStack sandbox within your own environment.

To get more details on how to up and run your instance check out the
[infrastructure documentation](https://github.com/GovStackWorkingGroup/sandbox-infra).

Deploy [USCT use case](https://github.com/GovStackWorkingGroup/sandbox-usecase-usct-backend/blob/main/docs/diy.md) to [minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/hello-minikube/).
