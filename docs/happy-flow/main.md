# Minimum Viable Product (MVP) eg. Happy Flow

## Overview
The USCT MVP is built based upon the technical sandbox and the USCT simulation. Itâ€™s intended to enable a vertical
penetration (re-define vertical penetration) of GovStack based on a slice of the journey of the use case "Unconditional
Social Cash Transfer" in order to make a common exemplary journey accessible to all teams and groups. **It is a technical
proof of concept and example implementation for the GovStack community.**

Full documentation of the use case is in a 
[dedicated repository](https://github.com/GovStackWorkingGroup/product-use-cases/tree/main/example-implementations/unconditional-social-cash-transfer).
