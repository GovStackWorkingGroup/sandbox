# Backend logic
Server side is responsible to cover very minimum part of workflow and use fragments from BB functionality, there will be
no errors, corner cases and non-compliances.

## Steps
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram

Civil servant ->> MOCK SRIS: provide Foundational id
Civil servant ->> MOCK SRIS: approve beneficiary enrollment
participant im as IM
MOCK SRIS ->> Payment mock: Beneficiary onboarding 
MOCK SRIS ->> Payment mock: Prepayment validation 
MOCK SRIS ->> Payment mock: Bulk disbursement
MOCK SRIS -->> Civil servant: Result
```

## MOCK SRIS
It's a [driver app](https://github.com/GovStackWorkingGroup/sandbox-portal-backend) which is responsible to implement
happy flow functionality.

## API mapping

### Fetch citizen data from the ID BB
Personal ID is a param to fetch data.
MOSIP is responsible to provide data ([Foundational ID](../terminology-abbreviations.md#foundational-id-system)).
```json

### Fetch citizen data from the registry BB
Personal data fetch from created [citizen registry data](main.md#created-citizen-registry) through Foundational ID from MOSIP.

### Merging
[Related API specification](https://govstack.gitbook.io/bb-registration/v/registration-1.0/7-service-apis#eforms-eformid)

Merging data from ID and Registry BBs.

functionally data from registry via personal ID


Entering citizens personal ID into the E-Form. (E-Form created from trough UNCTAD solution otherwise
[Registration BB]()) citizens personal data will be pulled and personal data fields filled automatically
with mocked data in CR Citizen Registry (UNCTAD)
(see [Registration](https://govstack-global.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DEMO/pages/179601480/Registration) )


```json
{
  "eFormId": "d98a205a-679b-485b-823d-7a32a391e744",
  "name": "A1",
  "description": "string",
  "version": "1",
  "latest": true,
  "schema": {
    "additionalProp1": {
      "FoundationalID": "",
      "PersonalID": ""
      }
    }
  }

```
1. No biometric data
2. No language data


### Link/choose benefit program to citizen
list of mocked programs is provided (OpenIMIS) (see  [Registration](https://govstack-global.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DEMO/pages/179601480/Registration) )

It should come from https://oleksii-1.gitbook.io/open-imis/2-api#provide-benefit-program-details-product-details  
Provide Benefit program details (Product details) endpoint in OpenIMIS

### Registration
Add additional benefit related information (payment due date, payment amount, account no â€¦) to the BOMS form (OpenIMIS) (see  [Registration](https://govstack-global.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DEMO/pages/179601480/Registration) )
It will be performed through Sandbox provided UI

#### Prerequisites
[API specification](https://govstack.gitbook.io/bb-registration/v/registration-1.0/7-service-apis#8.1-online-registration-e-services)

#### Eligibility and enrollment decisions
Need to find related API specification.

#### Determination of benefits and service package
Need to find related API specification.

### Submit benefit package to the citizen
Payment request triggered from OpenIMIS, which is background functionality.
