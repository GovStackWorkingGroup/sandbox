## Unconditional social cash transfer
This use case profiles specifically the digital integration steps within the delivery journey of a generalized unconditional social cash transfer service. Unconditional cash transfers are cash payments provided to financially disadvantaged or vulnerable people or households without requiring anything in return (i.e. without conditionality).

Implementation and more details you can find in the [Mock-SRIS repository](https://github.com/GovStackWorkingGroup/product-use-cases/blob/main/product-use-case/inst-1-unconditional-social-cash-transfer.md).
