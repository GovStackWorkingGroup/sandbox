## Unconditional social cash transfer
This use case profiles specifically the digital integration steps within the delivery journey of a generalized unconditional social cash transfer service. Unconditional cash transfers are cash payments provided to financially disadvantaged or vulnerable people or households without requiring anything in return (i.e. without conditionality).

Implementation and more details in the [Mock-SRIS repository](https://github.com/GovStackWorkingGroup/product-use-cases/blob/main/product-use-case/inst-1-unconditional-social-cash-transfer.md).

## Building Permits
This use case profiles the implementation process of a construction permit. A service that automates the entire construction permit approval process - from enabling online application submissions of building construction plans, to initiating verification and final approval by the local government authorities.
