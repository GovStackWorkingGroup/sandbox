# Social Cash Transfer Use Case

<img src="../.gitbook/assets/file.excalidraw.svg" alt="" class="gitbook-drawing">

Unconditional Social Cash Transfer (USCT) programs help families meet their basic needs for well-being and safety and serves as their path to self-sufficiency. USCT are cash payments provided to financially disadvantaged or vulnerable people or households without requiring anything in return (i.e. without conditionality).

This demo covers only a small fraction of a USCT user flow for the purpose of using various Building Block APIs. For a more comprehensive visualization of the use case visit the [GovStack USCT simulation](https://www.govstack.global/our-offerings/govspecs/simulation/).

## Which GovStack <mark style="background-color:blue;">features are demonstrated</mark>?

With this use case implementation, we demonstrate the GovStack approach through...

### Use Case Frontend Walk Through

Registry Officer ID: `7495681570`\
Enrollment Officer ID: `9038952310`\
Payment Officer ID: `2405176278`\
OTP: `1 1 1 1 1 1`

Open the [Use Case Frontend](https://usct.playground.sandbox-playground.com/driver-poc/) and follow these steps to navigate through the demo.\
_In italic, read a very simplified version of the BB interactions._

<details>

<summary>Walk Through Steps</summary>

1. Click "Log in with e-signet"\
   _The user gets forwarded to the UI of the Identity BB. Demonstrating UI Switching_
2. Click "Log-in here" and enter the ID `9038952310` **to log in as Enrollment Office**
3. Enter `1 1 1 1 1 1` as One Time Password (OTP)
4. As fictional **Enrollment Officer give consent** to using essential personal information (You do not give consent to use your personal data! It is only for demonstration purposes.)\
   _The user gets forwarded back to the Use Case Frontend UI with respective role parameters<mark style="color:purple;">.</mark>_
5. Enter the "Candidate Database" and **enroll any person** to any available benefit package\
   _The user gets a list of candidates requested by the Use Case Backend from the Registry BB channeled through the Information Mediator BB._
6. After returning to the overview page, click on your profile in the top-right to **log out**\
   _The user triggers the Use Case Backend to request the Registry BB to change the enrollment status of a candidate._
7. Repeat the log in procedure with the ID `2405176278` **to log in as Payment Officer**\
   _Again, the user gets forwarded through the UI of the Identity BB._
8. Enter the "Beneficiary Database" and mark (check box) a person to **order payment**
9. Confirm Payment Order\
   _The user triggers the Use Case Backend to request the Payment BB to issue a payment order. They Payment BB returns successful execution of the payment._
10. Optional: Log in with the ID `7495681570` **to log in as Registry Officer** and **create new candidates.**

### Building Block UIs

Administrative UIs of the Building Block Software (X-Road, MOSIP, Mifos Payment Hub) can only be demonstrated by GovStack Initiative staff, until we implemented a secure way to expose the Admin UIs publicly. If you are interested, please [contact us](https://www.govstack.global/about/contact/).

## How are the stack components <mark style="background-color:blue;">assembled</mark>?
