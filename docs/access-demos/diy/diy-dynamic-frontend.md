# DIY dynamic frontend

This prototype can be used to only test and demo a functional frontend or do decouple frontend and backend development until it can be merged at a later point in time. 

{% hint style="info" %}
Dynamic frontend implemented via RPC Layer concept that is based on the Facade Pattern. In short, we are using it as a configurable API layer. It allows us granular control over our API call method endpoints from one location, which is good for demonstrating connectivity between different interchangeable Building Blocks. In addition, the RPC layer can also be configured for different providers, such as MockProvider, APIProvider, LocalStorageProvider, etc.
