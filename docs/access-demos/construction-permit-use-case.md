GIZ processes personal data exclusively in accordance with the [EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/DE/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679\&qid=1527147390147\&from=EN) and the [German Federal Data Protection Act (Bundesdatenschutzgesetz, BDSG)](http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/bdsg\_2018/index.html).\
Personal data are, for example, name, address, email addresses and user behaviour.

GIZ only processes personal data to the extent necessary. Which data is required and processed for which purpose and on what basis is largely determined by the type of service you use or the purpose for which the data is required.

This type of cookie makes it possible to assign different requests from a browser to a session and to recognize the browser when you visit the website again (session ID).

**Collection of personal data when visiting a web application**

When visiting a [web application](construction-permit-use-case.md#access-points), GIZ itself processes only the data that is automatically transmitted by the browser and technically required in order to display the website correctly and to ensure its stability and security.

* Method (The requested action, for example, a GET method.)

* Server Port (The server port number that is configured for the service.)
* Client IP Address (The IP address of the client that made the request.)&#x20;
* User Agent (The browser type that the client used.)
* Referrer (The site that the user last visited. This site provided a link to the current site.)

The data in the log file is temporary stored. The log retention time depend on amount of requests, service up time and other factors.

**Further information on the storage and transfer of data:**

GIZ is obliged to store data beyond the time of the visit in order to ensure protection against attacks on the GIZ’s internet infrastructure and the communications technology of the Federal Government (legal basis: Art. 6 (1) (e) GDPR in conjunction with Section 5 BSI Act). In the event of attacks on communications technology, this data is analyzed and used to initiate legal and criminal prosecution.
