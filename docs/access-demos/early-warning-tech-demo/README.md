# Early Warning - Tech Demo

<img src="../../.gitbook/assets/file.excalidraw (1).svg" alt="" class="gitbook-drawing">

The demo of a early warning system focuses on efficient communication between civil servants and communities in a given region. The system enables civil servants to validate raw threat information and create broadcasts to inform communities about potential hazards, while collecting structured feedback from recipients.

Acknowledgement: This use case has been developed in cooperation with the _IGAD Climate Prediction & Applications Centre_

## Which GovStack <mark style="background-color:blue;">features are demonstrated</mark>?

With this use case implementation, we demonstrate the GovStack approach through...

{% hint style="success" %}
**Modular and scalable architecture**

A-synchronous data exchange between micro services / Building Block enables future scaling to additional messaging channels, sectors and recipients. See architecture diagram below.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
**Integration of Building Blocks Software**

For this demo, we chose the following software applications (does not imply a recommendation):

* BB Messaging: RapidPro (for bi-directional communication)
* BB Information Mediator (Pub/Sub): Kafka
* BB Registry: PostgreSQL
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
**Backend Visualization**

As core features of the demo are hidden in the backend, we implemented a side bar visualizing the handling of broadcasts by micro services and Building Blocks.

## How to <mark style="background-color:blue;">navigate</mark> through the demo?

**Threat:** Raw information regarding a warning or potential hazard. This is what admins (civil servants) see and use to create broadcasts.&#x20;

**Broadcast:** Information that is shared with a group of end-users. These are created based on threats and distributed to affected people.

**Feedbacks:** Messages received in response to broadcasts or about ongoing situations.

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### Log-in

Authentication is done with a simple mock-up (no _Identity BB_)
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Watch current and past threats and broadcasts

Threats have been ingested from external sources (e.g. hazard watch). Both threats and broadcasts are stored in databases representing the _Registry BB_.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Draft a broadcast

Based on a threat, a broadcast is created and title, languages, content, channel, recipients are added by the admin.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Sent a broadcast

The submitted broadcast will be sent to the _Information Mediator BB_ (PubSub). From there, the communication service add recpient data and sents the complete broadcast to the _Messaging BB_ to be sent to a SMS service provider.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Receive feedback by recipients (deactivated)

The Messaging Building Block receives a response, gives a label and saves the response. In this demo, this functionality is deactivated.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}
