# Use Case Backend
Within the core GovStack Initiative, "reference use cases" are used to provide context and limit scope of the various GovStack Building Blocks. These use cases are considered to be part of GovStack and are versioned and released alongside the Building Block Specifications when a given GovStack release occurs.

## Unconditional Social Cash Transfer
This use case profiles specifically the digital integration steps within the delivery journey of a generalized unconditional social cash transfer service. Unconditional cash transfers are cash payments provided to financially disadvantaged or vulnerable people or households without requiring anything in return (i.e. without conditionality).
