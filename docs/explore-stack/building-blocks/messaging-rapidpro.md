# Messaging: RapidPro

[RapidPro](https://home.rapidpro.io/) is a robust messaging platform chosen as a software option for the Messaging Building Block within the GovStack framework. It is designed to facilitate effective communication between government services and citizens, enabling timely and relevant interactions.

RapidPro is an open-source platform developed by UNICEF that enables users to design, scale, and manage communication workflows using channels like SMS, Telegram, and WhatsApp. It provides a user-friendly, visual interface for building interactive messaging services, widely used in sectors like health, education, and disaster response. Key features include flow creation, contact management, real-time analytics, and multi-channel communication.

RapidPro is acting as a GovStack building block software, meaning it is a modular solution designed to be reused across different government services and digital infrastructure projects. It has the potential to be leveraged in various GovStack implementations to streamline communication, citizen engagement, and service delivery across digital platforms.

In the [Early Warning demo](../../access-demos/early-warning-tech-demo/), we used a RapidPro SaaS offering. There are at least two offerings on the market:

* [RapidPro](https://app.rapidpro.io/) (UNICEF)
* [TextIt - The Leading Bot Platform](https://textit.com/)
