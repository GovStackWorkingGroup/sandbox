# GovStack Design Sprint

## About the GovStack Design Sprint

The concept of the GovStack Design Sprint is based on the [GV Design Sprint](https://www.gv.com/sprint/) and adapted to the needs of the e-government product development endeavours and GovStack specifically.

This intensive five-day sprint is designed to address vital service inquiries through the application of design, prototyping, and testing techniques, utilizing feedback from real-world users such as citizens and civil servants. This methodology encapsulates key principles of business strategy, innovation, behavioral science, design thinking, and policy, condensed into a rigorous, thoroughly vetted process suitable for use by teams across various domains.
