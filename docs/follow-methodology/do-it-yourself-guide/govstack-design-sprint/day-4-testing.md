### Where rubber meets the road

First, start with feedbacking the outcomes from the previous day.&#x20;

This is where the rubber meets the road, as the team observes real users interact with the prototype. When planning this day, it's essential that you've carefully recruited a representative sample of users to ensure meaningful feedback. The testing environment should mimic the real-world context in which the product will be used to capture authentic user behavior and reactions.

Prepare a test plan that outlines the key features and tasks you want to observe, and craft a script to guide interviews for consistency. Make sure to communicate to your team that this is about learning, not validating their ideas; hence, embracing a neutral stance during user interviews is crucial.

Be ready to capture feedback effectively, whether it's through note-taking, audio recordings, or video. Assign specific roles such as facilitator, note-taker, or observer to each team member to streamline the process.

After testing, gather your team to debrief and discuss the insights. Look for patterns in user feedback that will help you understand what works, what doesn't, and why. This is the foundation for iterating on your prototype and moving towards a solution that genuinely meets user needs.

Remember, the objective of this day is to learn and answer critical questions about your product's usability and appeal to the target audience, so
