### How to ideate

Time management, or timeboxing, is crucial. Clarify the days agenda upfront.

When preparing for a day of ideation and prototyping, clear objectives are important. You should review the to be journey and service blueprint in the beginning for this purpose. Afterwards, start the ideation with warm-up exercises to stimulate creative thinking. Whether it's through icebreakers, quick sketches, or word games, the goal is to loosen up thought patterns and ease participants into a creative flow.

Effective facilitation is key during ideation. The facilitator should be able to guide the team through the ideation process, manage time, encourage full participation, and help steer the direction without stifling creativity.

In the first half of the day, the focus can lie on the actual ideation.

Employ structured ideation techniques such as mind mapping, sketches, Crazy Eights, or exploring "How Might We" questions to systematically uncover innovative solutions. These methods encourage expansive thinking while leveraging the collective intelligence of the group. Make use of methodology that fits your needs, given the type of service your're designing for and the group you're designing with.

In the afternoon, depending on the type of testing you're planning to do, you can split up the group. Technical consultant and Business Analyst can draft a first Architectural and Business Model, Designer and Manger can put together a lo-fi prototype if possible or needed and prepare the user testing for the next day.
