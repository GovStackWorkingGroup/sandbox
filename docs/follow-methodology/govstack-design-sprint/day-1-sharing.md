# Day 1 - Sharing

The first day is all about sharing information and onboarding all participants to the problem space. It's important to establish a common understanding for what's going to be worked on. This makes it possible to work on this together in the first place.

## How to get started

Journey mapping is a powerful visualization tool that outlines the steps a person takes to reach a goal, offering invaluable insights in transforming eGovernment services.

It's recommendable to start by sharing findings from the different areas after introducing to the existing as-is-journey. These findings should be used to expand the as-is-journey and to enrich it with user centered information. For this, especially the inclusion of a civil servant or other government official concerned with the matter can make a big difference.

These information will help for the second part of the day, where the collaborative effort to set up the to-be-journey is the primary and shared goal.

Finally, the team finishes Monday, when a to-be-journey is in place, including all possible pain points from user perspectives and insights collected upfront.&#x20;
