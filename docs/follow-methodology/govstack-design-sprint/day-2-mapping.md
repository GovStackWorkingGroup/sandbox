### What is a service blueprint?

A service blueprint is a diagram that visualizes the relationships between different service components — people, props (physical or digital evidence), and processes — that are directly tied to touchpoints in a specific customer journey.

Service blueprints are companions to user journeys. They help to see the big picture of how a service is implemented and used. They pinpoint dependencies between the service entities and users in the same visualization. They are instrumental in identifying and optimizing complex interactions, ultimately saving money for the organization and improving the experience for its users.

Service blueprints are created based upon the to-be user journey which was developed on day 1 of the sprint. They comprise a series of diagrams that visualize the relationship between:

* Processes
* Different service users and entities involved in providing the service&#x20;
* Actions and goals of entities and users&#x20;
* GovStack Design Patterns&#x20;
* Required documents, Data input and output&#x20;
* Building Blocks
