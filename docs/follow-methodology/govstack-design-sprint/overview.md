## Tips and Tricks

* Eliminate distractions. All personal electronic devices, including laptops, phones, and iPads, are prohibited. If you need to use your device, step outside the room or wait until a break.
* Implement a timebox. A strict schedule fosters trust in the sprint process. Use a Time Timer to foster concentration and a sense of urgency. Schedule lunch later in the day.&#x20;
* Have a snack break and lunch around 1pm. This timing helps maintain energy levels and avoid busy lunchtime periods.
* If you're doing the Sprint on location, prepare supplies such as whiteboards, printer paper, pens, markers, tape, sticky notes etc.
* For remote sessions, please make sure to establish the setup up front and make sure that everyone is able to join from a calm environment. Prepare a technical backup solution.
