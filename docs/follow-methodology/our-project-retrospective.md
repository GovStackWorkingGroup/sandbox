# Our Project Retrospective

The project hasn't ended. But with accomplishing major milestones, we felt the need to publicly share ways of working we did or should have done earlier in the project. It shall serve as a repository of teachings for future project managers, scrum masters and alike implementing a Building Block based system. We welcome contributions to let this piece grow!
