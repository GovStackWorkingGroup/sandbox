# Phase 1 - Research

In the research phase, we gathered essential information and insights to inform the design of the sandbox Building Permit Use Case within the GovStack ecosystem. This phase involved:

1. **Receiving/Analysing Input**: Collecting specific input from the implementing country, including the existing user journey (as-is) and the desired user journey (to-be) for the Building Permit Use Case. To map out the desired user journey, we used [this template](https://www.figma.com/file/w9oqWWuuxWtab5EPJIVhhA/Journey-Template?type=whiteboard\&node-id=0-1\&t=SPjZ4uB69Oz8IKW6-0). This input provides a foundation for designing user-centered solutions.&#x20;
2. **Market Research**: Conducting a thorough analysis of the market to validate the collected input against industry standards and best practices. This step ensures that the proposed solutions align with established norms and expectations.

This research phase served as the groundwork for creating a design that not only meets the needs of the implementing country but also aligns with GovStack specifications, ultimately resulting in a well-informed and user-centric approach to the Building Permit Use Case design.

## Receiving and Analysing Input

The respective user journeys are a good starting point as they hold relevant information for the whole process of the service. For an overview of the GovStack Journey Mapping, please watch this video: &#x20;

<summary>Our User Journey Template</summary>

Our [Journey Mapping Template](https://www.figma.com/file/w9oqWWuuxWtab5EPJIVhhA/Journey-Template?type=whiteboard\&node-id=502-3589\&t=2jbkrrXKAmGpPeg6-0) created based on the processes that are involved within our implementation playbook. It produces important base for our next steps such as service blueprint and wireframing.

With this template you can easily create your own as-is and to-be journey. As-Is journey will allow you to understand current state, pain points of the user, opportunities and legal background within the flow while to-be journey will allow you to ideate and plan the future state based on the different personas.

Please do not hesitate to change, remove or add new segment and perspectives depending on your use case and scope

We initiated the research process by gathering country-specific input. This included understanding the existing (as-is) user journey and identifying the desired (to-be) journey of the Building Permit Use Case. For our case, the primary reference deliverables came from Djibouti.

In addition to the To-Be journey mapping from Djibouti, we analysed the generic [Construction Permit Service use case documentation](https://govstack.gitbook.io/use-cases/readme/inf-1-construction-permit) by GovStack. This provided an overview of the construction permit use cases in which we broke it down and analyzed it further to improve our knowledge and understanding of the use case and derive the design based upon that.

## Market Research

We conducted comprehensive market research to validate the collected input against industry standards and best practices, ensuring alignment with the received input.

This research was conducted for:

* **Familiarizing with the market:** This phase enabled us to grasp the intricacies of the construction permit process, including regulatory requirements, stakeholder roles, and the challenges faced by both applicants and government agencies.
* **Creating inspiration for design solutions:** We explored a wide range of case studies, both within and outside the construction permit domain, to draw inspiration from successful user experiences and innovative design solutions. By analysing real-world examples, we aimed to identify creative approaches and best practices that could be applied to our design.
* **Comparing:** Recognising that construction permit processes may vary between countries and regions, we conducted a comparative analysis to identify commonalities and disparities. This cross-cultural examination allowed us to design our service that is sensitive to the common needs and expectations of our imaginary government, while also considering global best practices.
* **Expectation Management:** Informed by our research, we set clear expectations for our design process and outcomes, ensuring that all stakeholders understand the rationale behind our design decisions. By effectively managing expectations, we aimed to foster a collaborative and transparent working relationship with our stakeholders, facilitating smoother project execution.

This research aimed to validate the input gathered from various sources against industry standards and best practices, thereby ensuring that our design aligns seamlessly with the needs and expectations of our imaginary government client and its constituents.
