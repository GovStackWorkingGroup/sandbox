# Phase 4 - Deliver

For the GovStack Sandbox project so far, the delivery phase consisted of publishing use case demos on GitHub and GitBook and use the demos for capacity development together with our partner countries.

As a reader following these phases and aiming for implementation of use cases in your countries live systems, we will collect additional readings and offerings of GovStack in the following list:

* [Frontend Development Recommendations](../frontend-development.md) by the Sandbox Developer Team
* Public Administration Ecosystem Reference Architecture (PAERA) (coming soon)
