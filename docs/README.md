# GovStack Sandbox

The GovStack Sandbox is a unified environment for all the GovStack and digital government
ecosystem actors to discover, understand, engage, experiment, innovate, and build digital
government solutions using the [GovStack platform](https://govstack.global).

The sandbox is not just a playground, but rather a publicly available kit of tools, including:
* cloud infrastructure configurations
* container images
* CI/CD pipeline configurations
* Helm charts for building blocks.
 
This means that you have the flexibility to take these repositories and set up your own sandbox environment.

The fully operational environment offers a comprehensive API that public and private agencies can use to mimic the
characteristics exhibited by the GovStack platform and environment on a real-time basis to help simulate responses from 
all the systems an application interfaces with. This especially enables government agencies and digital government 
players to experiment with innovative GovTech products or services within a well-defined space and duration. The design 
of the GovStack sandbox encapsulates the business logic and data necessary to represent multiple GovStack capabilities 
such as APIs, [building blocks](https://govstack.gitbook.io/specification/building-blocks/about-building-blocks), use 
cases and transaction flows. This helps developers and digital government agencies 
to achieve a more holistic view of the GovStack.

## Candidates for building blocks
In the Sandbox, you have the freedom to configure your own setup and run any 
[building blocks](https://govstack.gitbook.io/specification/building-blocks/about-building-blocks) of your choice.
