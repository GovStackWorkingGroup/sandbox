# Enter the Sandbox

The GovStack Sandbox is a demonstration environment for **digital teams from governments and service providers** to **learn** and **test** how to technically implement the GovStack approach.

## What <mark style="color:blue;">value</mark> does the sandbox offer?

### Learn

The design of the GovStack sandbox encapsulates the business logic and data necessary to **represent multiple GovStack capabilities** such as APIs, Building Blocks, use cases and transaction flows. This helps developers and digital government agencies to achieve a more holistic view of the GovStack approach.

[Access the various demos](access-demos/usct-use-case.md) and [explore the software stack](explore-stack/architecture.md#what-do-we-use-to-build-it) behind these demos. Additionally, you can learn from our development experience at [follow methodology](follow-methodology/our-service-design-approach/).

### Test

The fully operational environment offers a comprehensive API that public and private agencies can use to **mimic the characteristics exhibited by the GovStack Specifications**. Therefore, it offers an environment on a real-time basis to help **simulate responses** from all the systems an application interfaces with. This especially enables digital government players to **experiment with innovative GovTech products or services** within a well-defined space and duration.&#x20;

[Deploy a replication](access-demos/diy/) of the GovStack Sandbox and experiment with the software architecture.

### Reuse

In addition to the demo and test purpose, the Sandbox offers a **publicly available kit of tools**, including:

* Cloud infrastructure configurations
* Container images
* CI/CD pipeline configurations
* Helm charts for Building Blocks

You have the flexibility to take these repositories and set up your (1) own copy of the GovStack Sandbox environment or (2) re-use the tools to build your own customized sandbox.

## What <mark style="color:blue;">value</mark> does the sandbox <mark style="color:blue;">not</mark> offer?

* The Sandbox is _not_ an off-the-self testing environment for your countries e-Government stack. To resemble your IT systems and therefore be of practical testing use for your existing IT context, you would need to customize the Sandbox.
