# Minimum Viable Product (MVP) eg. Happy Flow

## Overview
The USCT MVP is built based upon the technical sandbox and the USCT simulation. It’s intended to enable a vertical
penetration (re-define vertical penetration) of GovStack based on a slice of the journey of the use case "Unconditional
Social Cash Transfer" in order to make a common exemplary journey accessible to all teams and groups. **It is a technical
proof of concept and example implementation for the GovStack community.**
