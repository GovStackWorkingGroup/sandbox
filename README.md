# GovStack Sandbox

This template is intended to be used by the various GovStack building block
repos. Each building block repo will have at least 4 main sections, outlined in
the directory structure below.

## Gitbook and the published "Building Block Specifications" document

Note that pushes to the `main` branch will automatically trigger a Gitbook build
and deployment from the `/spec` directory.

## Repo Structure

```sh
README.md
/spec # the markdown files which are used to build the specification in GitBook

/examples # examples for deploying, configuring, and testing applications which implement the behaviors specified by this building block
  /application-a
